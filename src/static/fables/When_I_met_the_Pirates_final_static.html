margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>When Peter woke up that
morning, like he did every morning, he looked out of the window to see if it
was snowing.  You see, if there was snow, they would close school and he could
stay home all day and make snowmen and throw snowballs at them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US> Anyway, today when he
looked out of the window there was no snow.  There was sunshine, blue sky, and
big white fluffy clouds, but definitely no snow. And it was Monday. He would
have to go to school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>It’s not that Peter
didn’t like school – he liked it fine.  But school didn’t like him, and he
couldn’t really understand why.  He turned up on time, and did his homework,
but the teachers would still call on him when he didn’t know the answer and he
didn’t even raise his hand.  They’d say things like “stop doodling’, and “pay
attention’, and “wake up’, but he didn’t see what it mattered if he was drawing
or daydreaming or even taking a nap.  After all, he was there, and he was
pretty sure that was all he really had to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>And today was just like
every other day.  Peter walked to school, out of his house, left turn down the
street, and then a sneaky little turn through some bushes to his favorite short
cut along the canal.  He first walked down the path and then started running.  He
ran until he could run no more.  Peter loved to run, he loved the wind on his
face, feeling himself getting warmer and warmer until he felt the first bead of
sweat on his brow.  He would look down and watch his feet, going faster and
faster over the gravel path, thinking he was going so fast his feet were like
the pistons in an engine.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>When Peter finally
stopped, he looked around, and wondered how far he had gone.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“I’ve run for hours” he
said to himself (although we know he ran for about ten minutes). “I must be in
another country by now. An amazing country, where there’s no school, and no
teachers, and only exciting adventures. In this country I don’t have to go to
school. And best of all, I don’t have to learn anything.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter was tired from
running, and he decided to sit by the canal, and wait for the adventure. He lied
down on the grass and then fell asleep.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter hadn’t been
asleep for even five minutes when he heard splashing on the canal and a
roaring, rustling sound.  He sat up and couldn’t believe what he saw!  He
rubbed his eyes, just to be sure.  It was true! Right there, in front of his
very eyes, was the biggest, most beautiful ship he’d ever seen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>It had flapping red
sails, creaking oak sides, with cannons poking out of every window, and a
beautiful carved princess painted with shimmering gold right on the prow.  It
had to be the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US> “Ahoy there” Peter
called, as loud as he could. “Ahoy!!!!!!!”</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Oi , matey!” came a
small voice from the ship. “No need to shout, I can hear you just fine! But
show yourself, scoundrel, show yourself to Salty, the fiercest Pirate ever!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter stood on his
tiptoes and peered up over the side of the ship. At the wheel, was a little
white dog, with a big brown spot on his back, and a brown tip to his tail.  But
more peculiar than a dog steering a ship, was that he was wearing an eye patch.
And he was looking the other way, so Peter couldn’t see if he had a patch on
his other eye too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Show yourself, I say”
the dog bellowed, “Don’t make me unleash the cannons!”</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“I’m right here”, said Peter,
“right next to you.”</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Salty turned his head,
and Peter saw his other eye. It was big, and brown, and looked friendly and
gentle.  Salty didn’t look fierce to Peter.  In fact, he looked a little old,
and more than a little small.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Ahhh. I see. A young
land-loving scallywag.  And up to no good I’m sure!” the little dog said,
crossing his little arms and tapping his paw. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“I’m no scallywag” said
Peter, although he didn’t know what a scallywag was, so he couldn’t really be
sure if he was one or not. “I’ll have you know, I’m a brave adventurer!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Hmmmm” said Salty.  “A
brave adventurer, eh?  Funny, you look more like a little boy to me.  If you’re
no scallywag, why aren’t you in school?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“I don’t like school.” Peter
said. “I’m going to run away and find adventures, fame, and fortune far, far
away.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US> “I see,” said Salty,
rubbing his chin, trying to look serious and not laugh. “Well, if you don’t go
back to school, how will you learn?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“I don’t need to learn
anything!” Peter said defiantly “I’m brave enough to travel the world all by
myself, and that’s what I’m going to do!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Well, I suppose you do
seem very brave.” Salty said.  “I know you said you want to be all by yourself,
but I could use a good First Mate. Why don’t you hop aboard and come with me,
at least until we get to Faraway Lands, than you can go off and make your own
way.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Well”, Peter thought,
“I really did want to do this on my own, but I suppose I could help you out for
a little while.” Peter secretly felt very glad of some company, at least to
start his adventure.  He could be brave later.  He grabbed the ship’s ropes,
and pulled himself aboard. “But just until we get to Faraway Lands.  Then I’m
afraid you’ll just have to manage without me.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Very well,” said
Salty, “very well.” And as he watched Peter start to explore the ship, he
sighed and shook his head. He whispered to himself…”that little boy has a lot
to learn.  A lot to learn indeed.”</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter hadn’t been on
the ship for five minutes when he bent down to pick up a piece of rope, and he found
it was attached to a cat.  In fact, it wasn’t a rope it all, it was a tail. 
Even though Peter had picked him up by his tail, the cat seemed to take quite a
while to wake up.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“That’s true,” came
another voice from above Peter’s head. “A piece of rope is a useful thing on a
ship. You, Peinard, are anything but useful.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter turned around to
see a beautiful parrot, with feathers all the colors of the rainbow, perched
high up on the rigging.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Mind you,” said the
parrot, cocking her head and looking slyly at Peter, “I can’t see how a
land-loving little boy is going to be much use either.”</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter was just about to
reply, and explain to the rude parrot just how useful he’d be, when another
voice piped up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Don’t judge him for
his youth, Franqui,” said a small, elderly sounding voice, from somewhere near Peter’s
head.  A rat’s nose soon poked out from behind some crates, so close Peter
could almost feel his whiskers on his face – and certainly close enough that Peter
could smell him. “Now, when I was a lad, new to the ships, I was still…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Here we go again!” the
cat spoke again. “Ladino is going to tell us all about his famous ancestors,
who, I might point out, are still vermin.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter looked down at
the cat, sideways at the rat, and up at the parrot.  They continued to argue,
and Peter looked back and forth at them, wondering what to do, when Salty
turned up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Enough” Salty shouted,
standing with his hands on his hips, and looking really, really disappointed. 
“Don’t you all have work to do?” And off they scampered, even Peter.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Away they sailed, over
crashing waves, day and night.  The sun grew hotter, and even at night it felt
so hot you would think the sun was still shining.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter had a lot of
important jobs on the ship. He had to climb up the tall mast to roll up or
unroll the sails, he had to wind up the ropes neatly, and he had to tie a lot
of knots.  Every day Salty showed him a new knot, and he would practice with a
piece of rope until he had tied that knot so many times he would never forget
how.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>One day Peter saw Salty
looking intently through a long telescope out to sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Laaaaaaaand Hooooooo!”
Salty bellowed.  Peter put his hands over his ears.  How did such a little dog
find such a big voice! They both stood there for a moment, then Peter saw it –
it had to be – Far Away Lands!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>On the horizon, a row
of green mountains appeared, growing bigger and bigger as they sailed closer. 
Soon the whole crew was lined up against the rails of the prow, leaning into
the wind, hair, fur, or feathers flapping, depending on who you were looking
at.  Peter watched in amazement.  Now his adventure would really begin! </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>They sailed closer to
the shore, and saw that the forest was a jungle, and the mountains were steep,
and they would not be able to land on the shore.  They saw the mouth of a wide
river, and decided to sail upstream to look for a place to stop.  For days they
sailed up the wide, muddy river, deeper and deeper into the jungle.  Finally
the river slowed, got even wider, and in the middle was an island, with a beach
perfect for landing.  They ran the ship onto the beach, and everyone hurried
about with ropes and boxes and tents to secure the ship and set up a camp.  But
Salty seemed concerned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“We need to find some
fresh water – this river is too dirty.  And we need some more food.  Peter, why
don’t you take someone with you and go and look for water and food?” Peter
looked around, but Ladino the rat was shuffling up to him as fast as he could.
Truth is, old, fat rats can’t shuffle very fast. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“I’ll go with you Peter,”
he said. Peter scooped up Ladino, put him on his shoulder and off they went. 
The whole way, Ladino sat next to Peter’s ear, and told him stories of his
famous Spanish ancestors who sailed in a famous fleet called the Armada. Peter
wasn’t really listening.  He had heard something about the Armada in school,
and he didn’t come out here to have an adventure that was just like school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>They walked all the way
around the island – twice –and then they decided to wade across the river and
see what was on one of the shores.  To stay away from the water Ladino had
climbed right to the top of Peter’s head and hanged on to Peter’s curly hair.
Every now and then, Ladino would wiggle about, and tumble down over Peter’s
face, right across his eyes, so he couldn’t see, or his nose, so he couldn’t
breathe. And he never stopped talking. “Why doesn’t he fall over my ears so I
can’t hear?’ Peter wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Soon they reached the
other side and climbed up on to the bank. They scrambled deeper into the jungle.
Ladino finally stopped talking, and started sniffing. “Peter” he said, “I smell
water!” And sure enough, right in front of them was a beautiful, clear
waterfall.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>They ran up to it, and
just as they reached the water’s edge, and could almost taste the fresh cold
water, suddenly a wall of little brown monkeys rose up in front of them. The
littlest, brownest, monkey spoke first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“What do you think
you’re doing?” he said. Peter thought he was a lot like Salty – he had quite a
big voice for quite a small animal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“We need some water,” Peter
said, trying to be as polite as possible, and wishing he'd been listening when his
mother had lectured him about good manners. “Do you have enough to spare us
some?”</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Oh we have plenty of
water,” the monkey said, and in Peter’s opinion he didn’t say it very nicely.  “We
have this beautiful waterfall with clear, sweet water. It’s just that you can’t
have any.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:9.0pt;margin-bottom:10.0pt;
margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Peter was somewhat
surprised by this. “Why not?” he asked.</span></p>

margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>“Well, we have water,

Jackal’s tail (he was pulling so hard to get away he fell on the floor), and clasped
his paws over his mouth in horror. </span></p>

latest adventure!</span></p>

back home, he thought.  How far away and long ago that seemed now.  He decided
to settle in for  a nap, and see what adventure awaited him at the next stop,
wherever that may be.  He went below decks, found a hammock, and fell asleep,
Peinard snuggled up beside him.</span></p>

some kind of magic? Were Salty, his crew, and his ship all magical? Peter
didn’t care.  He took out his books, and waited for the teacher to start. 
Today, he knew the answers.  He would even raise his hand. Whatever had
happened, it was magic to him.</span></p>
