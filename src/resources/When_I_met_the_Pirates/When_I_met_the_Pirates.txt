Chapter 1. {name} woke up

When {name} woke up that morning, like {she_he} did every morning, {she_he} looked out of the window to see if it was snowing.  You see, if there was snow, they would close school and {she_he} could stay home all day and make snowmen and throw snowballs at them.

Anyway, today when {she_he} looked out of the window there was no snow.  There was sunshine, blue sky, and big white fluffy clouds, but definitely no snow. And it was Monday. {She_He} would have to go to school.

It's not that {name} didn't like school - {she_he} liked it fine.  But school didn't like {her_him}, and {she_he} couldn't really understand why.  {She_He} turned up on time, and did {her_his} homework, but the teachers would still call on {her_him} when {she_he} didn't know the answer and {she_he} didn't even raise {her_his} hand.  They'd say things like "stop doodling', and "pay attention', and "wake up', but {she_he} didn't see what it mattered if {she_he} was drawing or daydreaming or even taking a nap.  After all, {she_he} was there, and {she_he} was pretty sure that was all {she_he} really had to do.

And today was just like every other day.  {name} walked to school, out of {her_his} house, left turn down the street, and then a sneaky little turn through some bushes to {her_his} favourite short cut along the canal.  {She_He} first walked down the path and then started running.  {She_He} ran until {she_he} could run no more.  {name} loved to run, {she_he} loved the wind on {her_his} face, feeling {herself_himself} getting warmer and warmer until {she_he} felt the first bead of sweat on {her_his} brow.  {She_He} would look down and watch {her_his} feet, going faster and faster over the gravel path, thinking {she_he} was going so fast {her_his} feet were like the pistons in an engine.

When {name} finally stopped, {she_he} looked around, and wondered how far {she_he} had gone.

"I've run for hours" {she_he} said to {herself_himself} (although we know {she_he} ran for about ten minutes). "I must be in another country by now. An amazing country, where there's no school, and no teachers, and only exciting adventures. In this country I don't have to go to school. And best of all, I don't have to learn anything."

{name} was tired from running, and {she_he} decided to sit by the canal, and wait for the adventure. {She_He} lied down on the grass and then fell asleep.  

{name} hadn't been asleep for even five minutes when {she_he} heard splashing on the canal and a roaring, rustling sound.  {She_He} sat up and couldn't believe what {she_he} saw!  {She_He} rubbed {her_his} eyes, just to be sure.  It was true! Right there, in front of {her_his} very eyes, was the biggest, most beautiful ship {she'd_he'd} ever seen. 

**IMG[wim_picture1.jpg,15.5,12] 

It had flapping red sails, creaking oak sides, with cannons poking out of every window, and a beautiful carved princess painted with shimmering gold right on the prow.  It had to be the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. 

"Ahoy there" {name} called, as loud as {she_he} could. "Ahoy!!!!!!!"

"Oi , matey!" came a small voice from the ship. "No need to shout, I can hear you just fine! But show yourself, scoundrel, show yourself to Salty, the fiercest Pirate ever!"

{name} stood on {her_his} tiptoes and peered up over the side of the ship. At the wheel, was a little white dog, with a big brown spot on his back, and a brown tip to his tail.  But more peculiar than a dog steering a ship, was that he was wearing an eye patch. And he was looking the other way, so {name} couldn't see if he had a patch on his other eye too.

"Show yourself, I say" the dog bellowed, "Don't make me unleash the cannons!"

"I'm right here", said {name}, "right next to you."

Salty turned his head, and {name} saw his other eye. It was big, and brown, and looked friendly and gentle.  Salty didn't look fierce to {name}.  In fact, he looked a little old, and more than a little small.

"Ahhh. I see. A young land-loving scallywag.  And up to no good I'm sure!" the little dog said, crossing his little arms and tapping his paw. 

"I'm no scallywag" said {name}, although {she_he} didn't know what a scallywag was, so {she_he} couldn't really be sure if {she_he} was one or not. "I'll have you know, I'm a brave adventurer!"

"Hmmmm" said Salty.  "A brave adventurer, eh?  Funny, you look more like a little {girl_boy} to me.  If you're no scallywag, why aren't you in school?"

"I don't like school." {name} said. "I'm going to run away and find adventures, fame, and fortune far, far away."

"I see," said Salty, rubbing his chin, trying to look serious and not laugh. "Well, if you don't go back to school, how will you learn?"

"I don't need to learn anything!" {name} said defiantly "I'm brave enough to travel the world all by myself, and that's what I'm going to do!"

"Well, I suppose you do seem very brave." Salty said.  "I know you said you want to be all by yourself, but I could use a good First Mate. Why don't you hop aboard and come with me, at least until we get to Faraway Lands, than you can go off and make your own way."

"Well", {name} thought, "I really did want to do this on my own, but I suppose I could help you out for a little while." {name} secretly felt very glad of some company, at least to start {her_his} adventure.  {She_He} could be brave later.  {She_He} grabbed the ship's ropes, and pulled {herself_himself} aboard. "But just until we get to Faraway Lands.  Then I'm afraid you'll just have to manage without me."

"Very well," said Salty, "very well." And as he watched {name} start to explore the ship, he sighed and shook his head. He whispered to himself..."that little {girl_boy} has a lot to learn.  A lot to learn indeed."

Chapter 2. The bananas way

It so happened that {name} wasn't Salty's only First Mate.  In fact, there were quite a few.  And they were very interesting characters.  

{name} hadn't been on the ship for five minutes when {she_he} bent down to pick up a piece of rope, and {she_he} found it was attached to a cat.  In fact, it wasn't a rope it all, it was a tail.  Even though {name} had picked him up by his tail, the cat seemed to take quite a while to wake up.

"What, exactly do you think you're doing?" the cat mewed, sounding decidedly grumpy. "You can't just go around picking folks up by the tails, you know, just because you don't have one!"

"I'm so sorry, cat," {name} said, "I mistook your tail for a piece of rope."

"A piece of rope?" said the cat indignantly, "how could you mistake my beautiful, silky tail, for a piece of old rope?"

"That's true," came another voice from above {name}'s head. "A piece of rope is a useful thing on a ship. You, Peinard, are anything but useful."

{name} turned around to see a beautiful parrot, with feathers all the colors of the rainbow, perched high up on the rigging.

"Mind you," said the parrot, cocking her head and looking slyly at {name}, "I can't see how a land-loving little {girl_boy} is going to be much use either."

**IMG[wim_picture2_small.jpg,15.5,12]

{name} was just about to reply, and explain to the rude parrot just how useful {she'd_he'd be}, when another voice piped up.

"Don't judge him for his youth, Franqui," said a small, elderly sounding voice, from somewhere near {name}'s head.  A rat's nose soon poked out from behind some crates, so close {name} could almost feel his whiskers on his face - and certainly close enough that {name} could smell him. "Now, when I was a lad, new to the ships, I was still..."

"Here we go again!" the cat spoke again. "Ladino is going to tell us all about his famous ancestors, who, I might point out, are still vermin."

{name} looked down at the cat, sideways at the rat, and up at the parrot.  They continued to argue, and {name} looked back and forth at them, wondering what to do, when Salty turned up.

"Enough" Salty shouted, standing with his hands on his hips, and looking really, really disappointed.  "Don't you all have work to do?" And off they scampered, even {name}.
 
Away they sailed, over crashing waves, day and night.  The sun grew hotter, and even at night it felt so hot you would think the sun was still shining.  

{name} had a lot of important jobs on the ship. {She_He} had to climb up the tall mast to roll up or unroll the sails, {she_he} had to wind up the ropes neatly, and {she_he} had to tie a lot of knots.  Every day Salty showed {her_him} a new knot, and {she_he} would practice with a piece of rope until {she_he} had tied that knot so many times {she_he} would never forget how.

One day {name} saw Salty looking intently through a long telescope out to sea.

"Laaaaaaaand Hooooooo!" Salty bellowed.  {name} put {her_his} hands over {her_his} ears.  How did such a little dog find such a big voice! They both stood there for a moment, then {name} saw it - it had to be - Far Away Lands!

On the horizon, a row of green mountains appeared, growing bigger and bigger as they sailed closer.  Soon the whole crew was lined up against the rails of the prow, leaning into the wind, hair, fur, or feathers flapping, depending on who you were looking at.  {name} watched in amazement.  Now {her_his} adventure would really begin!

They sailed closer to the shore, and saw that the forest was a jungle, and the mountains were steep, and they would not be able to land on the shore.  They saw the mouth of a wide river, and decided to sail upstream to look for a place to stop.  For days they sailed up the wide, muddy river, deeper and deeper into the jungle.  Finally the river slowed, got even wider, and in the middle was an island, with a beach perfect for landing.  They ran the ship onto the beach, and everyone hurried about with ropes and boxes and tents to secure the ship and set up a camp.  But Salty seemed concerned.

"We need to find some fresh water - this river is too dirty.  And we need some more food.  {name}, why don't you take someone with you and go and look for water and food?" {name} looked around, but Ladino the rat was shuffling up to him as fast as he could. Truth is, old, fat rats can't shuffle very fast. 

"I'll go with you {name}," he said. {name} scooped up Ladino, put him on {her_his} shoulder and off they went.  The whole way, Ladino sat next to {name}'s ear, and told {her_him} stories of his famous Spanish ancestors who sailed in a famous fleet called the Armada. {name} wasn't really listening.  {She_He} had heard something about the Armada in school, and {she_he} didn't come out here to have an adventure that was just like school.

They walked all the way around the island - twice -and then they decided to wade across the river and see what was on one of the shores.  To stay away from the water Ladino had climbed right to the top of {name}'s head and hanged on to {name}'s curly hair. Every now and then, Ladino would wiggle about, and tumble down over {name}'s face, right across {her_his} eyes, so {she_he} couldn't see, or {her_his} nose, so {she_he} couldn't breathe. And he never stopped talking. "Why doesn't he fall over my ears so I can't hear?' {name} wondered.

Soon they reached the other side and climbed up on to the bank. They scrambled deeper into the jungle. Ladino finally stopped talking, and started sniffing. "{name}" he said, "I smell water!" And sure enough, right in front of them was a beautiful, clear waterfall.  

They ran up to it, and just as they reached the water's edge, and could almost taste the fresh cold water, suddenly a wall of little brown monkeys rose up in front of them. The littlest, brownest, monkey spoke first.

"What do you think you're doing?" he said. {name} thought he was a lot like Salty - he had quite a big voice for quite a small animal.

"We need some water," {name} said, trying to be as polite as possible, and wishing {she'd_he'd} been listening when {her_his} mother had lectured {her_him} about good manners. "Do you have enough to spare us some?"

**IMG[wim_picture3_small.jpg,15.5,12] 

"Oh we have plenty of water," the monkey said, and in {name}'s opinion he didn't say it very nicely.  "We have this beautiful waterfall with clear, sweet water. It's just that you can't have any."

{name} was somewhat surprised by this. "Why not?" {she_he} asked.

"Well, we have water, but we have no food. No bananas grow on this side of the river. So, we need bananas.  If you bring us some bananas, you can have some water. Simple as that."

{name} felt helpless again but {she_he} thought for a minute, and then {she_he} got an idea.

"Okay then", {name} said. "We'll go get some food, and then we'll come back." And they turned around and were on their way. Back through the river, across the island, and across the river on the other side, Ladino talking all the way. 

Soon they reached the other side and climbed up on to the bank. They scrambled deeper into the jungle.  Ladino finally stopped talking, and started sniffing. "{name}" he said, "I smell bananas!" And sure enough, right in front of them was a grove of banana trees, full of giant bunches of yellow fruit.  

They ran up to it, and just as they reached the trees' edge, and could almost taste the fresh bananas, suddenly a wall of little white monkeys rose up in front of them. The littlest, whitest, monkey spoke first.

"What do you think you're doing?" he said. {name} thought he was a lot like Salty - he had quite a big voice for quite a small animal.

"We need some bananas," {name} said, trying to be as polite as possible, and wishing {she'd_he'd} been listening when {her_his} mother had lectured {her_him} about good manners. "Do you have enough to spare us some?"

**IMG[wim_picture4_small.jpg,15.5,12]

"Oh we have plenty of bananas," the monkey said, and in {name}'s opinion he didn't say it very nicely.  "We have this beautiful grove with hundreds of banana trees. It's just that you can't have any."

{name} was somewhat surprised by this. "Why not?" {she_he} asked.

"Well, we have bananas, but we have no water. No water flows on this side of the river. So, we need water.  If you bring us some water, you can have some bananas. Simple as that."

{name} thought this whole thing seemed kind of familiar. {name} felt helpless again but {she_he} thought for a minute, and then {she_he} got an idea.

"Okay then", {name} said. "We'll go get some water, and then we'll come back." And they turned around and were on their way.

{name} and Ladino walked back to the island.  {name} sat down; we need water to get bananas, and we need bananas to get water. Now what do we do?

"Now, {name}," Ladino said.  "You're a clever {girl_boy}.  You've been to school.  How would you get these silly monkeys to see sense?"

"I don't know," {name} replied, a little sadly, sitting down heavily. "At school, nobody listens to me."

"Well, of course they don't, if you think they won't." Ladino said.  "People don't listen to me either, they don't listen to my wonderful stories. But that doesn't mean I stop talking. I still have something to say. And - you'd be surprised how much people hear even when you think they aren't listening"

"You're right!" said {name}, jumping to {her_his} feet.  "I know how to fix this, and I'll get those monkeys to listen. It's for their own good!"

And off {name} went, fists clenched, and almost stomping. {name} reached the end of the island, stood as tall as {she_he} could, and called out "who's the king of the monkeys?!' as loud as {she_he} could.

Sure enough, quick as a flash, a brown monkey appeared on the bank to his left, swinging in on a vine ({name} wondered why he hadn't thought of that), and almost at the same time, a white monkey swung in to his right.

"You called?" each monkey said, in unison. 

"Which one is the king?" {name} asked, looking from one monkey to the other. 

"I am", each monkey said, again at the same time. The two monkeys looked at each other, anger crawling over their faces. 

"I know how to decide", {name} said.  "The real king would provide for his entire kingdom, provide food and water. Which one of you does that?"

The monkeys looked at each other, looked down at the ground, and shuffled around nervously.  "I provide half of that!" each one said.

"Well, I guess that makes each of you half a king." {name} said.  "That's no good to me.  I need a whole king."

The two monkeys looked at each other, rubbed their chins, and scratched their heads. They stepped closer, turned their backs to {name}, and whispered to each other. Then they turned around suddenly, and spoke again - in unison.

"I provide both" each monkey said. "I trade for what I need, and I provide food and water to my kingdom. That makes me a whole king." And with that each monkey disappeared, and retuned quick as a flash.  One with a leaf folded up and full of fresh water, the other with a big banana.  The monkeys exchanged their goods, shook hands, and turned to {name}, looking rather smug.

**IMG[wim_picture5.jpg,15.5,12] 

"Two whole kings!" {name} said.  "I am fortunate. Because I need the help of two proud kings!" The monkeys looked very pleased with themselves indeed, and were soon employed directing their kingdom to load the ship with bananas and water, and swinging back and forth across the river carrying water one way, and bananas the other.  They were all so busy trading their goods they didn't even notice when {name}, Ladino, Salty, Peinard, and Franqui climbed aboard the ship and set sail. 

"See who listens", Ladino said, "when you have something to say?"

{name} watched the monkeys as they disappeared into the distance. "Gosh" {she_he} said. "They really did pay attention to me.  And look how happy they are. They really listened."

"Yes they did, {name}." Ladino said softly, "yes they did."

Chapter 3. Up to the North

Salty turned the ship North, and they sailed back onto the open sea. The air grew colder, but the days grew longer. {name} thought this was very strange, because when {she_he} was at home, when the days got longer, it meant summer was coming, and the air got warmer. Salty saw him puzzling, and came to help.

"Something on your mind {name}?" Salty asked.  "How come you didn't set off on your adventure back in the jungle?"

"I think I had my adventure there." {name} said. "Now I'm looking for another one, and maybe we'll find it. But I don't understand.  How can it be getting colder when summer's coming?" {name} pulled his collar up, and shivered a little.  The wind picked up, and the seas grew rough.

"Well," Salty explained. "We're heading for the Arctic.  It's at the top of the world.  So, in the summer – which lasts for six months , the sun shines all day, and all night, but it's still not enough to make it warm.  But you should see it in the winter - the ice pours down over the earth like maple syrup on your pancakes! And the snow and wind are so fierce you can't even open your eyes, but it doesn't matter, because the sun doesn't rise and it's night for another six months."

"Gosh!" {name} exclaimed, "It sounds magical - when do we get there?"

"That's the spirit, my {girl_boy}!" Salty slapped {name} on the back.  He knew {name} wouldn't be disappointed.  The Arctic always had an adventure for everyone.

It took many weeks to arrive.  {name} helped out on the ship, while Peinard slept, Ladino talked, and Franqui told everyone what to do, without doing very much herself.  {name} could see now why Salty said he needed a good First Mate; the others were more good-for-nothing.

It wasn't much longer when they started to see signs of reaching the Arctic.  Huge pointy icebergs would float past, and sometimes it would snow just a little.  

"Snoooooooooow Hooooooo!" Salty cried, from the highest deck.  The whole crew ran to see where they were, and what it looked like, but all they could see was white.  The gray sea just turned into a white desert.  Just like in the jungle, there was nowhere to land, so they sailed along the shores for days and days.

{name} saw amazing animals all along the shore - penguins, little white foxes, and seals, who would dance around the ship and then disappear quick as a flash into the dark, cold water.  All the animal s seemed very busy.  {name} thought that was rather odd; when it was cold and snowy at home, {name} pretty much just wanted to stay indoors and sit by the fire.

"It's no use," said Salty. "We just can't land.  Two of you will have to go ashore in the rowboat."

"I'll go," Peinard said, "and of course {name} will too." And off they went.  The journey was a little more difficult than last time.  Peinard didn't want cold paws, so he rode on {name}'s shoulders, but he was a lot heavier than Ladino.  And, the snow was kind of crunchy and kind of deep, and {name} had to walk like a giant, taking big, long steps. At least Peinard was quiet, although he was pretty fidgety.

Well, the thing about adventures is, you don't really find them.  They find you. And so it happened to {name} and Peinard.  {name} took one especially big step, and as {she_he} put {her_his} foot down {she_he} felt the ground shake.  They could hear a terrible roar, like a growl coming from underneath them.  

"Did I do that?" {name} exclaimed, "Did I break the Arctic!?"

"No," said Peinard, although he looked a little sheepish. "I think it's coming from over there." Peinard pointed ahead.

"Let's go see!" {name} shouted, excited that something was finally going to happen! 

Peinard wasn't so sure.  He wasn't keen on adventures, and this really sounded like a big one.  {name} started off as fast as {she_he} could, making big, long steps, but this time doing them faster. {She_He} didn't even notice that Peinard had to use his claws to hold on.

But then it was over. {name} took another especially big step, and...

"Whoa-oa!" {name} cried. They were teetering at the edge of the ice, with icy water lapping below their feet. "Where did the Arctic go?"

Peinard was first more concerned that they should take one big long step backwards, so they didn't fall in, but then he stopped worrying about that.  He started worrying about something else.

"Ummmm...{name}..." Peinard whispered, tapping {name} on the shoulder. "I think we have a problem..."

"What is it Peinard? There's no problem. We won't fall in. I know what I'm doing. I'm a brave adventu - " and {name} stopped short. {She_He} saw what Peinard was talking about.  An enormous, white, fluffy polar bear was coming right toward them! Although, {name} had to admit, it wasn't approaching very fast and it didn't look angry.  Or hungry.

"Hello there!" {name} called. {She_He} thought it would be best to take the first step and try to make friends with it.  Peinard snapped {name} out of his daydream.  "What ARE you doing?!" He yowled. "Wouldn't it be better to RUN?!"

"Nonsense", {name} said. "I'm here for an adventure, and here my adventure is." Peinard suddenly wished he was back on the boat, taking a nice long nap.

"Hello!" the bear called back, and soon he had reached {name}, and they were standing nose to nose.  {name} had only ever seen polar bears in the zoo. {She_He} hadn't realized how big they were up close.  They looked at each other for a minute.

"I don't suppose," {name} asked, a little nervously, "that you've seen any food anywhere? You see, we would like to be on our way, but we need provisions."

"No," the bear replied, "but I know where the food is.  It's over there." And he pointed out to sea. "The ice has broken away. We're on an iceberg now. And just over there, just over the horizon, there's land, the snow is melting for summer, and there's lots to eat."

"Well, let's go then." {name} said. 

"How?!" the bear and Peinard said, in unison, and the bear suddenly realized Peinard was there, and thought he looked a little tasty. Peinard recognized that look on the bear's face, and snuggled as far as he could down {name}'s collar.

"Well," said {name}, "Peinard and I need a boat. But we're in the Arctic, so what we really need is another iceberg. With all this ice, that shouldn't be too difficult." And with that, {name} started to jab at the snow with {her_his} heel. Peinard clutched at {name} with his claws.  He wasn't quite so sure it would work.

"What about me?" the bear said, and {name} thought he looked a little sad.  {name} realized nobody had ever relied on him before. It was a big responsibility. Especially when it's a bear that's relying on you.

"Well," {name} said. "You have a very important job. You need to swim, and push along, because we don't have an oar."

The bear stood up on his hind legs, clasped his front paws, and grinned. "I have a very important job?!' He was very excited about it. He'd never had a job before, let alone an important one. Then he suddenly looked crestfallen. 

"What's the matter?" {name} said. 

"I can't swim." The bear said, and he looked very ashamed.

"But I thought all polar bears could swim." {name} was a little shocked.

"Well I can't. So I guess I can't help you."

**IMG[wim_picture6.jpg,15.5,12] 

"Have you ever even tried? I mean, even I can swim, and I can't do much of anything."

"No, I've never tried. Are you crazy? Look at that water. It's cold, it's dark, and there's waves."

{name} looked at the water. It was true. It was cold, it was dark, but the waves were very small indeed. 

"A polar bear that can't swim? That isn't natural." Peinard said. "All polar bears can swim.  Sooner or later this bear will have to swim, or he'll starve." {name} had to do something. 

"I tell you what," {name} said. "We need to cross the water. And without an oar, we need you to do it. I'll make an ice boat. But you are too heavy to climb in. What you can do is hold on to the back, and kick your legs, and push us to shore."

The bear wasn't too sure about that, but it would have to do.  Anyway, {name} was already kicking at the ice with {her_his} heel, and cracks were starting to form. Even Peinard - who liked the idea of being on a boat again, especially if the bear wasn't in it - was jumping up and down in the snow. 

"Okay" said the bear. And with that he stood up as tall as he could, and slammed his front paws down on the snow. There was a loud crack, and the next thing {name} knew, {she_he} and Peinard were back at sea!

But it didn't quite go to plan. The bear was left behind. He was standing at the edge of the ice, swaying back and forth and wondering what to do. 

"Come on!" {name} said "We need you! JUMP!"

{name} hoped Peinard was right and that all polar bears could swim. Peinard was usually right. He just had to get this bear to see it. The bear took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and leapt into the water.  His front paws flailed about, reaching for {name}'s iceberg. {name} was a little concerned that if the bear did actually reach them, he'd tip them all into the water, and while {she_he} could swim, {she_he} didn't like swimming in cold, dark, wavy water. Peinard was already digging his claws into the ice.

But the bear didn't tip them in.  He soon stopped flailing about, and looked around. He was swimming! And, more than that, it was actually fun! He started to giggle.

"Look at me! Look at me!" he cried.

"I knew you could do it!" {name} said. "You just didn't know you could!"

The bear reached the iceberg, pushed it with his nose, and they were on their way.  It would only be a short journey to the shore, and a short journey back again.  {name} couldn't wait to tell Salty all about it. 

"It's amazing what you can do and not even know it" {name} said, "all you have to do is try."

"You're right {name}," Peinard said, snuggling down for a nap until they reached the shore. "You're absolutely right."

Chapter 4. Never taste a chicken

After {name} and Peinard had returned from their adventure, bringing food from ashore, they set sail again. Salty turned the ship south, and they set off onto the open sea.

It wasn't long before the air grew warm again. They sailed deep into the south, where the earth is widest and the sun is hottest.  Everyone grew sleepy with the heat, especially Peinard, who seemed to never wake up.  {name} never saw him move, but he was always in a different spot, wherever there was shade or where {name} had just washed the deck and the damp wood was still cool.  Even Ladino was quiet.  Only Franqui stayed busy.   Funny how birds never seem to notice the heat. 

All the time Salty steered the ship.  Even in the heat of the day, he'd be there, watching for land and guiding them toward their destination, wherever it was.  All of a sudden, Franqui started squawking!

"Laaaaaaaand Hooooooo!" she cried.  Ladino awoke, but Peinard didn't even stir, not a whisker, not even a little twitch of his tail.

Sure enough, ahead of them was land.  No mountains this time, just beach.  It was all brown, scorched by the sun, the sand fading into dry yellow grass, and sadly, {name} thought, no sign of shade.

Salty steered them ashore.  "So, {name}, who will you take with you this time?" he asked.

{name} looked around.  Peinard wasn't excited about landing, and even Ladino looked weary from the heat. 

 "I guess it Franqui should come with me", {name} said.  Even he wasn't all that excited about an adventure.  He just wanted to find some shade and snooze.  But maybe they would find a nice cool waterfall where he could have a swim, or a grove of coconut trees with cool shade and a gentle breeze.  {name} smiled, and then snapped back from {her_his} daydream.

"Alright Franqui, let's go!" {she_he} cried, and they were on their way.

"It's about time I got to do something." Franqui said. "And these good-for-nothing sailors, why, just look at them.  Sleep , sleep,sleep..."

As she rambled on, sitting on {name}'s shoulders and chattering away into his ear, {name} wondered if even Ladino would have been a quieter choice.

They climbed over the sand dunes, and set off into the tall grasses.  The grass was dry, and as the wind blew through it, it swayed, and made an eerie sound.  The grass was so tall they soon lost their way, and even when he looked behind him, {name} saw that the grasses had closed right back up, covering their trail.  Never mind {she_he} though, Franqui can always fly up and show me the way back.  {She_He} thought that was a very brave thing to think, and proud of {herself_himself}, {she_he} puffed out {her_his} chest and strode confidently on.

After what seemed like hours of walking, {name} pushed aside the grasses to find a clearing in front of him.  Just a little clearing, with a little hut, and some piles of sticks around, and what looked like a little well. Water! {name} was certainly parched, and there was almost no water left on the ship, so maybe {she_he} could have a little drink, and even take some back for the crew.

"Hellooooo?" {name} called.  Franqui cocked her head to one side to listen.  No reply.  {name} approached the well, and peered over, and Franqui leaned down to get a closer look.  {She_He} couldn't see if there was any water down there, and then Franqui lost her balance, and with a great fluttering of wings, panicked squawks, and {name} trying to unpick her sharp talons form his hair and shoulders, suddenly {she_he} felt a painful thump on his back!

**IMG[wim_picture7_small.jpg,15.5,12]

"What was that????" {name} cried, rubbing {her_his} back. "Did someone just throw something at me?"

Franqui let go, and flew around the well and perched on its edge, trying to compose herself.  

"Oh, my!" he cried.  "Look, {name}, look!" {name} turned around.  There in front of {her_him} was the ugliest dog {she'd_he'd} ever seen. Wait until {she_he} told Salty! He'd never believe it.  This dog had front legs longer than his back legs, a big chest like a wild pig, a bear's ears, a scruffy tail, full of weeds and knots, and was spotted all over.  It snarled at {her_him}, then laughed.  A horrible, shrieking kind of laugh. Franqui looked a little nervous, and looked for a higher perch. This demon dog picked up another rock, and was about to throw it when it stopped, and spoke.

"Do you mind?!" the animal barked.  Its voice was as ugly as its body. "I am trying to have a meal with my friend Jackal!"

"Sorry," {name} said, "we didn't mean to disturb you.  My name's {name}, by the way." And {name} stretched out {her_his} hand to the dog.  {She'd_He'd} seen dogs shake hands before, but {she_he} wasn't sure of this dog was the sort to learn tricks like that. The animal just stared at {name}'s hand, then licked his chops like he was wondering if {name} had offered it as a snack.

"I'm Hyena. Now be quiet, or go away."

"I wonder if we could borrow some water?" {name} asked, ever so timidly. {She_He} was beginning to notice that Hyena was looking at {her_him} like {she_he} was food.

"Certainly not." Hyena said. "But you may be able to get some from the village. It's not far.  You are welcome to join us for a little meal, if you like.  Jackal brought it, and he's a wonderful cook." Hyena thought {name} looked tasty, but {she_he} needed to fatten up a little.  A few more meals and {name} would make a fine meal himself.

{name} wasn't sure what Jackal would be like.  Would he be even bigger and fiercer than Hyena? Still, {she_he} was tired, and {she_he} was hungry.  

"I'd love to." {name} said, "Thank you very much!' {she_he} could see, out of the corner of his eye, Franqui shaking her head in disbelief.

"I'll wait here" she said, from the roof of the hut. "If you're not out soon, or I hear any trouble, I'll go and fetch the others, although I don't know what good they'd do, the lazy layabouts..." {name} left her chattering on and went inside the hut.

To {her_his} surprise, Jackal was actually quite handsome. He was quite a bit smaller than Hyena, so {name} thought he must be pretty brave. A dog too, of course, but with a sleek pointed nose, big pointy ears, a thick smooth coat, and a bushy tail.  And he looked much cleaner and more dignified than Hyena. They were seated at a little table, which had the better part of a chicken on it.

{name} sat down, and introduced himself to Jackal, and then took a piece of chicken for {herself_himself}.  Jackal was indeed a good cook. It was delicious.

"This is wonderful chicken, Jackal!" {name} said.  "I've never tasted such good chicken!" Indeed {name} hadn't, but it may have been because {she'd_he'd} never been quite so hungry before.

"It's NOT chicken!' barked Jackal. "It is the meat of a rooster."

"My," Hyena said.  "I didn't realize.  It is truly delicious.  Jackal, you must bring me the chicks of this rooster, so I may have this meal again myself!"

Now Jackal Knew Hyena was a comedian, but this time he couldn't tell if he was joking or not.  

"But Hyena," Jackal said, "Roosters are male. And male animals can't have children, so this rooster has no chicks."

Hyena looked at Jackal and grew cross. He flattened his ears and furrowed his brow.

"Now Jackal," he said slowly, leaning toward the smaller dog, "are you sure you're not just saying that so you can keep all the chicks for yourself?"

**IMG[wim_picture8_small.jpg,15.5,12] 

Jackal looked nervous.  "Certainly not!" he explained.  "I'd never play such a trick on you.  It's true, male animals don't have children! Isn't it {name}?" Jackal turned sharply toward {name}.  "Well? Isn't it?"

{name} didn't really want to get involved.  {She_He} looked from Jackal to Hyena, and back again.  Both were looking angrily at {her_him} now, tapping their paws on the table, waiting for {name} to settle the whole thing. {name} heard Franqui on the roof. "{name}! {name}!" she cried. "We really have to get going. We have to go to the village to get water for Salty!"

"Who is Salty?" Hyena asked, "How is this Salty so important to you, that you would leave us without settling this disagreement?" Hyena snarled a little, and {name} noticed Jackal edging slowly away from the table.

Suddenly {name} had an idea. 

"Oh," {she_he} said, "Salty the dog - Salty is like a father to me." This was, {name} thought, actually pretty true. "I have to bring him water.  And I have to go right now!"

Hyena slammed his paw on the table. "You'll be going nowhere! Not until you settle this!" {name} could hear Franqui shuffling about on the roof. "Just say anything, {name}, then get out of there!"

But {name} knew exactly what {she_he} was going to say.  {She_He} was starting to have lots of clever ideas these days, and each time they got {her_him} out of trouble on {her_his} adventures.  {She_He} really felt smarter and braver than {she_he} had ever felt before.

"Well, you see," said {name}, "I have to get water to Salty, because he's just had puppies and he needs fresh water to drink."

Hyena looked at {name} for a moment, and Jackal eyed the window and made ready to run away as fast as he could. Hyena scowled, then slowly started to laugh. His laugh grew bigger and bigger, into a horrible, shrieking, cackling laugh.

"Don't be ridiculous, you foolish little {girl_boy}! Dogs are just the same as hyenas and jackals..." and with that he reached a paw out and without even looking grabbed hold of Jackal's tail so he couldn't get away. "And everyone knows father dogs, father hyenas, and father jackals can't have puppies! Only the mothers can!" and Hyena laughed some more.

"But Hyena," {name} muttered, ever so carefully, "you just told Jackal the rooster had chicks. But if male dogs can't have puppies, surely male birds can't have chicks?"

Hyena gasped, let go of Jackal's tail (he was pulling so hard to get away he fell on the floor), and clasped his paws over his mouth in horror. 

"Oh my!" he cried, not laughing anymore.  He felt so foolish, so silly, he didn't know what to do.  Now Jackal was cross, standing at the table shaking a rooster drumstick at Hyena.

**IMG[wim_picture9.jpg,15.5,12] 

"That's right!" Jackal cried out. "You did say that! How silly of you! Wait until I tell the village!"

And with that, full of embarrassment and shame, Hyena leapt out of the window and ran away, disappearing into the tall grass.  {name} and Jackal shook hands, and Franqui flew down to the window.

"My, {name}, that was a bit risky!" Franqui said, "But well done.  Now, let's get some water and be on our way."

Jackal called his friends, and they all collected water from the well, and the jackals brought {name} lots of chickens for their journey.  With Franqui flying above them to guide the way through the tall grass, they carried the food and water back to the ship, {name} skipping all the way - {she_he} couldn't wait to tell Salty about {her_his} latest adventure!

Chapter 5. All things come to an end 

And off they sailed again.  {name} was glad to be leaving the baking sun, and as the weather grew cooler, {she_he} thought how mild and pleasant it had become.  This was more like the weather back home, {she_he} thought.  How far away and long ago that seemed now.  {She_He} decided to settle in for  a nap, and see what adventure awaited {her_him} at the next stop, wherever that may be.  {She_He} went below decks, found a hammock, and fell asleep, Peinard snuggled up beside {her_him}.

"Laaaaaand Hooooo!" came a cry from above, and {name} woke up suddenly.  {She_He} felt like {she'd_he'd} only slept for a few minutes! Where could they be? What adventure would {she_he} have today?

{She_He} stood up, and straightened out {her_his} clothes, stretched and took a deep breath.  The air smelled familiar.  {She_He} climbed up the ladders to the deck, and when {she_he} emerged into the sunlight, {she_he} couldn't believe {her_his} eyes.

They were back at the canal!  Right back where they had started from! Oh no!  

{name} ran up to the top deck, and looked around.  Peinard, Ladino, and Franqui were nowhere to be seen.  Only Salty was there, standing at the wheel, as always.

"What's going on?" {name} cried, "Why have you brought me home?"

"Now, now, {name}," Salty said, reassuringly.  "All good things come to an end. And our good thing, well this is its end.  You've been a marvelous First mate, {name}, brave, and strong, and clever. But it's not over for you - you still have one more adventure."

{name} gasped with excitement! "what is it?" {she_he} cried, "Tell me!"

"Well," Salty said, "now, you must go back to school."

 "Farewell, brave {name}!" Salty cried, "Remember, wisdom is in your brain, courage is in your heart, and adventure is in your soul!"

"Farewell!" {name} cried, "farewell, Salty!"

And with that the ship sailed back down the canal, disappearing into the fog. {name} looked around.  {She_He} was a little cold, and a little damp from the grass. But it didn't matter.  {She_He} was off to school, to tell everyone about {her_his} great adventures.  

{name} saw his backpack still lying on the grass where {she'd_he'd} left it. {She_He} reached down, grasped it firmly and swung it over {her_his} shoulder.  {Her_His} watch said 9:00 in the morning, and it was.  Everyone was arriving at school.  {She_He} straightened {her_his} shoulders, puffed out {her_his} chest, and strode confidently into the school.  

{name} looked at the calendar on the classroom wall, where the teacher crossed out days as they'd passed.  How long had {she_he} been gone?  {She_He} looked more closely.  {She_He} couldn't believe it.  {She'd_He'd} only been gone one day! How could that be?  Had there been some kind of magic? Were Salty, his crew, and his ship all magical? {name} didn't care.  {She_He} took out {her_his} books, and waited for the teacher to start.  Today, {she_he} knew the answers.  {She_He} would even raise {her_his} hand. Whatever had happened, it was magic to {him_her}.
