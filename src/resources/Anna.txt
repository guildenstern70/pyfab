Chapter 1.  On the Occasion of <her Ladyship's_ his Lordship's> Sixth Birthday

Once upon a time, a little <princess_prince> called <name> sat at <her_his> parents' feet, and wondered what it was all about.  Turning six, that is.  What did it mean to be six? 

Well, <she_he> was about to find out everything <she_he> needed to know about being six. Right in front of <her_him> was the most strangely dressed man <she_he> had ever seen - with a big pointy hat of red, yellow and green, and funny looking shoes with bells on his toes, and he had with him a beautiful gold guitar! 

Little <name> stared at him, and he began to speak.  "Dear <name>, I am Theodore" he said, "and I am your humble troubadour." 

And so the story began...

I have a story for you <name>, for your very special day.  It's a tale to make you wise, but it's full of twists and turns.  It's the story of what happened when a little <princess_prince> went to Aragon.

It's a story full of kings and queens, and all their servants too.  It's a story of weird things and wild beasts, and it will tell all you need to know about all the things you do not know. 

Now here's what happened when <name> went to Aragon.

It was a very special day, and the King and Queen were very proud.  They couldn't believe their little <girl_boy> had already turned six! But now it was time for <her_him> to leave the castle, and leave behind all <her_his> games and toys, and set out to learn about the world.  

The King would not hear of his <daughter_son> growing up to be a silly <lady_man>. It was time for little <princess_prince> <name> to go to school. <name> chose a little <pony_horse> named Sage to carry <her_him> on <her_his> journey, and they got him ready.  Little Sage had a bubble bath, and four brand new shoes. They lifted little <name>  onto the saddle, and music played, and everyone began to cheer.    When <name> rode out of the castle gates on little Sage, his hooves going clippity-clop on the cobblestones, the King filled with pride, and the Queen waved her hanky and cried big, silvery tears.

Chapter 2. The Trouble Begins

<name> and Sage rode along the winding lanes, across meadows full or wild flowers, and crossed little stone bridges over babbling brooks.  They passed the time making up songs for each other, singing happily all the way. 

They followed the road into the dark close trees of the forest, and the air grew cold and damp.  <name> shivered, and wished <she_he> were back among <her_his> friends at the castle, playing in the sunshine.  Growing up is hard, <she_he> thought.

They reached a crossroads, but there was no sign.  "Which way do we go?" <she_he> said, "What do you think, little Sage? You always know what's best."

Sage snorted and shook his head, and swished his tail. "I really do not know," he said, "and I do not know how to find out."

Just then a fox stepped gingerly out of the forest undergrowth.  He was a very fine fox, a real gentleman, dressed in a fine suit of blue velvet with bright gold buttons. His shoes were shiny and clean, and Sage thought that was very strange for someone who's just been walking round in the damp forest.

"Allow me to introduce myself", he said, "My name is Esprit, and I am very pleased to meet you. I see you are unsure which way to go.  Allow me to help you - I know every road in the forest!"

Sage snorted again, "Hmph!" he thought to himself. "I don't like this fox one little bit.  Everyone knows you can't trust a fox!" Sage was sure the fox was up to something.  "And anyway, how did he know we were lost?"

The fox smoothed his fine, bushy tail, and then he said "Now there is just one thing, little <princess_prince>.  I have a little problem of my own, and I need your help.  Perhaps you can help me, before I help you."

"In the forest lives a little mouse, and though he's small, he's very brave.  He stole my lunch, and I want it back.  I need your help with that."

Sage whispered to <name>, "So now we know what this fox is all about. Why would a fox need help to get his lunch back from a little mouse? This is not safe, <name> dear, we must take our chances on the roads, and not follow him into the dark woods."

<name> grew cross with Sage. "Now Sage," she said sternly, "don't be mean.  This kind fox needs our help, and we must give it. "

"Thank you, little <princess_prince>, for your kindness" the fox replied.  Esprit looked sideways at Sage and said to <name> "and don't listen to your silly <pony_horse>.  He's not seen much of the world, and he does not have your wisdom."

Sage grew angry and stomped his little hoof. 'We'll see who's wise, you crafty fox! " he said, shaking his head and swishing his tail. "You may think you're clever, but you're no match for me! " Sage turned his head and spoke to <name> , "Now <name>  dear, I must object, it's not wise to follow this sly fox.  But if you say that it must be so, then into the forest we will go. "

<name> nodded. <She_He> felt somehow she had to help Esprit, but <she_he> too was unsure what they would find as they followed the fox into the dark, damp, cold forest.

Chapter 3. The Mouse and the Cheese

<name>, Sage, and Esprit walked through the forest, picking their way through the bushes, fallen trees, and moss.  Sage stepped carefully, trying to keep his shiny new shoes clean, and <name> rode, ducking under the low branches and hanging vines.  Esprit strode ahead, knowing which way to go even though there was no path.  <name> began to worry that they would never find their way back.  Sage began to worry if there was no mouse at all, and they were on their way to becoming dinner for the fox and his pals.

"Is it much further Esprit?" <name> asked, <her_his> voice a little shaky with fear.  

"We should go back!" Sage muttered.

"It's only a mouse!" said the fox, "and look, there he is!"

And sure enough, right in front of them, but high in a tree, was a little mouse, and in his mouth was a very, very big piece of cheese.  The mouse didn't say anything - his mouth was full of cheese - but he looked very angry indeed.

"So," <name> thought, "this little mouse did steal the fox's lunch.  We must do something, because stealing just isn't right!"

<name> spoke first, and <she_he> spoke straight to the mouse. "Mouse, sir, please return the cheese."

The mouse crossed his little arms, and shook his head.

<name> went on, this time a little more firmly, and a little more angry. "Mouse, you are not being fair.  That meal does not belong to you, and anyway, it's far too fine a piece of cheese for a little woodland mouse like you.  You should stick to nuts and seeds, and leave fine foods to fine gentlemen, like Esprit."

Well, mouse considered himself to be a very fine gentleman indeed.  He did not like to hear <name> tell him that he was not good enough for a piece of cheese! His tiny fur bristled, and he furrowed his brow as his anger grew.  Finally, he began to shout. 

"Hey you, below, who do you think you are? Just as mice are for cats, cheese is for mice.  Everyone knows that! I'm no common city rat; I'm a country gent, with country tastes.  Fine wine, and cheese, are what I like, and this piece of cheese is mine alone!"

But as he shouted, and opened his mouth, the piece of cheese fell to the forest floor. The mouse roared on for several minutes, while the fox gobbled up the cheese, licked his lips, and smiled.

When the mouse saw what he had done, he flew into a terrible rage.  He stomped off back to his treetop house, went inside, and slammed the little door so hard the whole tree shook, and leaves tumbled down onto <name> and Sage.  

<name> thought for a moment about what had happened, and <she_he> watched fox delicately wipe the corners of his mouth with a fine silk handkerchief.  <She_He> had gotten fox's cheese back through trickery, yet foxes were meant to be the crafty ones.  <She_He> found <herself_himself> a little angry that Esprit had eaten the whole piece of cheese so quickly all by himself, when he must have known <name>  would be hungry.  

Esprit leaned against the tree, and patted his tummy, and said "So, <princess_prince> <name>, tell me now, what have you learned from the Fox, the Mouse, and what used to be a piece of cheese?"

<name> rubbed <her_his> chin, and scratched <her_his> head.  "I learned a thing or two about you," <she_he> said, "and next time I'll ask for my share! But most of all I learned that temper never leads to good, and anger only leads to loss. No matter what is said to me, no matter what anger others try to cause, I know I will be better off to show them patience, and to turn the other cheek."

Chapter 4. <name> Gets Hungry

Esprit the fox had a full belly now, and was ready to set off, and Sage hoped he'd take them back to the road and show them the way.  But <name>, having missed out on <her_his> share of cheese, was hungry, and it was time for <her_his> supper anyway.

"Dear Esprit, now we have helped you in your problem and it is time for you to help us with ours." <She_He> said. "But first, I am so very hungry, and you have eaten; could you find some supper for the two of us?"

Esprit did not seem at all concerned about taking them back to the road.  "I know a crane who lives nearby," he said, "and she is a wonderful cook.  I suggest we stop there and see if she would be kind enough to offer us a meal.  Soon it will be dark, after dinner I wonder if you two would be so kind as to stay the night with me in my den - I promise to make you very comfortable, and then I will help you resume your journey in the morning."

Sage was anxious to be getting on with their journey to Aragon, but even he was hungry, and it was getting late.  He did not know the way back to the road, and although he did not trust Esprit, even Sage knew it would be wiser to get some dinner and some sleep.  He would try to persuade Esprit and <name> to hurry back to the road in the morning. 

Esprit led them deeper into the woods, until they came to a small pond, thick and green with weeds and lily pads.  They could hear bullfrogs croaking, and knew that darkness was not far away.  On the edge of the pond stood a small but lovely house, with flowers all around, and pretty blue curtains in the windows.  Esprit strode up to the front door, and rapped firmly on the door with his knuckles.

After nearly a whole minute, the door slowly opened, and a great long beak poked out. "Who's there?" it croaked. "Who could be visiting at so late an hour?"

"Dear Mrs. Crane," said the fox, "it is Esprit, and I have some very noble friends with me, all the way from the castle. They are hungry from their journey, and you are an excellent cook; would you be so kind as to allow them to share your supper?"

The crane stepped outside, and looked at <name> and Sage.  "Well," she said, "your friends look plenty well-to-do to me.  How is it you ask me, a poor crane, to feed your fancy friends?"

<name> answered, "Please, Mrs. Crane, we did not plan for this detour.  We have not brought with us enough for supper, and we are very hungry indeed.  We will not ask for much, a bowl of soup would be enough."

The crane was clearly not happy about feeding the guests, and after much fussing, she finally agreed. "Fine, then," she said, "come inside, but mind you don't eat too much."

<name> and Sage looked at each other.  They were not used to such poor hospitality, but they were hungry, so they politely said "thank you" and went inside.  They sat down at the table, while the crane prepared some soup, muttering all the time under her breath.

The soup did smell fantastic, and the crane began to serve it up.  Esprit waved his paw to show that he didn't wish any (he had filled up on cheese, after all), but <name> and Sage eagerly awaited their dinner.  But Mrs. Crane had other plans.  She poured the soup into great tall vases, and set them at the table.  She began to greedily slurp her soup, sticking her great long beak into the neck of her vase.  

Sage looked at the vase.  He tried to fit his little nose into the neck of the vase, but even his tiny muzzle was too wide.  He tried this way, and that way, but try as he might, he couldn't reach the soup.

<name> didn't do much better. <She_He> stuck <her_his> spoon into the neck of the vase, and tried to reach the soup.  But <she_he> couldn't spoon up the soup, and when <she_he> brought out <her_his> spoon, all that <she_he> had were a few drops at the very end.  

<name> and Sage were going crazy - they were so hungry, and the soup was so near, but they just couldn't get to it.  Esprit watched their struggles, and laughed a little to himself.  Mrs. Crane pretended not to notice the frustration her guests were feeling, and carried on slurping her soup.  When she had finished, she looked at Sage and <name>, and grew quite cross indeed.

"What's the matter, is my soup not good enough for you?" she asked.

"No," said <name>, "it smells wonderful, it's just that -" and Mrs. Crane  interrupted. "Well, never mind, then," she said as she cleared away the vases, "all the more for me".
Esprit stood up and spoke. "Well, that's supper then, let's be on our way before it gets dark." <name> and Sage got up from their seats with tears in their eyes.   Esprit stopped, and spoke to the crane.  

"Say, Mrs. Crane," he said. "You have been most generous and kind." Sage let out a very angry cough at that remark, and Esprit waved his paw at Sage as if to say "be quiet". Esprit continued, "So that we may return your kindness, why don't you join us for breakfast in the morning?"

Mrs. Crane looked carefully at Esprit.  Like Sage, she knew that foxes were seldom to be trusted.  But there was nothing Mrs. Crane loved more than food, especially when it was someone else's.  She agreed, and they said their good nights to meet again at Esprit's house in the morning.

<name> and Sage had only just risen the next day, when there was a loud banging on Esprit's front door.  Esprit was making porridge, and the smell of warm oats and cinnamon had <name> and Sage fidgeting excitedly at the table, still hungry from the night before. They did not want to see Mrs. Crane again, but Esprit had invited them, and it was his house, so they would just have to put up with her. 

Esprit opened the door, and Mrs. Crane strode in. "Where's breakfast then?" she said. "I've come miles and I am so very hungry."

Esprit, always a gentleman, invited her to sit at the table, pulling out her chair for her.  She tucked the napkin around her neck, and clacked her beak. "Hurry up!" she squawked, "I'm starving!"  

Esprit brought the porridge to the table.  He had made it thick and rich with lots of honey, so you could almost eat it with a fork.  The porridge filled up the plates almost to the rim.  <name> and Sage thought it a little unusual to serve porridge on a plate, but they were so hungry they didn't care.  <name> picked up <her_his> spoon and tucked into <her_his> breakfast, and Sage's little velvet muzzle nibbled hurriedly on his porridge.  The crane, however, couldn't eat.  Her beak was so long and narrow that she couldn't reach the porridge.  Her beak just bounced off the plates, splattering porridge everywhere.

"I can't eat like this!" she cried, "Can't you see my bill won't reach?"

Fox chuckled a little.  "What's the matter, Mrs. Crane?" he asked. "Is my breakfast not good enough for you?"  <name> and Sage looked first at Esprit, then at the crane, and smiled.

Mrs. Crane didn't think it was very funny.  She stood up, looked at everyone, and waggled her wing at them all. "Well I never!" she said, and she stomped out, and took off into the air, with the napkin still around her neck.

Esprit sat down at Mrs. Crane's place, picked up a spoon, and began to eat.  "So, <name>", he said, "learned anything today?"

<name> nodded, and smiled.  "I certainly did, Mr. Fox." <she_he> replied. "I learned that how you are to others is how they will be to you.  I must show kindness if I wish others to be kind to me."


Chapter 5. The journey continues

<name> and Sage were really anxious to get on with their journey.  Their time with Esprit had been interesting, but <name> had to get to school.  <She_He> was afraid that <her_his> mother would worry if she found out they hadn't arrived in Aragon yet.  Sage, too, had had just about enough of Mr. Fox and all his little games.
"It's time to go", Esprit said, as if he could read their minds. "I'll take you back to the road and set you on your way.  It's a long walk, though, so we'd better get going."
<name> climbed aboard Sage, Esprit fastened the shiny gold buttons on his coat, and off they went.  They walked slowly on, and the sun streamed through the treetops and made pretty patterns on the forest floor.  Squirrels ran among the branches, and brightly colored birds fluttered through the leaves.  
They traveled miles through the woods, listening to the birds sing and the squirrels chatter.  <name> began to sing, and Sage smiled as he listened to <her_his> beautiful voice.  Neither one noticed that they seemed to be traveling much farther than if they had just gone back the way they'd come.  
Esprit looked back over his shoulder at the two of them and smiled.  "Everyone okay?" he asked. 
"Oh yes!" cried <name>. "It is so very beautiful here.  The sunbeams, the birdsong, the bluebells - I've never seen anything so beautiful! I could stay here forever!"
They walked on and on, and soon it began to grow dark.  Still neither <name> nor Sage noticed how far they had traveled, the forest was so beautiful.  Soon they walked out into a meadow, underneath the night sky, their path lit only by moonbeams.
"Oh Sage, look!" <name> gasped. "Look at the stars; have you ever seen anything so beautiful?" Sage looked up as he walked along. "No, <name>, I have not," he replied.  "They are truly beautiful.  Why, oh wise fox, do you not care to take notice of such a beautiful place?  You are very fortunate to live here, yet you don't bother to give it even a glance!"
Esprit shrugged his shoulders, and plodded on, picking his way along the path. "Esprit, you silly fox!" <name> said, still gazing at the sky. "The stars will laugh at you, for not bothering to notice how beautiful they are!".
"That may be, <name>" Esprit replied, "that may be."
Just then, the fox leapt over a huge ditch that crossed the path.  <name> and Sage were so busy gazing at the stars, and teasing Esprit that they never saw it, and down they tumbled into it!  Sage and <name> fell into a heap at the bottom, up to their middles in murky, muddy water!
"Oh no!" cried <name>, and "Ouch!" cried Sage, and they untangled themselves from the weeds and vines, and climbed out of the ditch.  Esprit looked at them, and chuckled, as they tried to shake off the water and the mud that covered them both.
"If the stars weren't laughing before," said Esprit, "they are surely laughing now!"
<name> scowled at Esprit. "It isn't funny!" <she_he> shouted angrily.  "Oh come now, <name> ", he replied "take a minute and tell me what you have learned."
<name> stopped and looked at Esprit, then looked at Sage, still covered in mud.  <She_He> looked at the path where they had come, and at the deep, murky ditch.  "I learned that sometimes you can look at the stars," <she_he> said, "but you also have to keep your eyes on the road.  You can dream, but you also have to keep your feet on the ground."

Chapter 6. The truth comes out

It would be fair to say that both <name> and Sage had had quite enough of Esprit's lessons, and they really wanted to get back to the road.  And as soon as they thought it, they stepped out of the forest onto the road.  

"Now, Mr. Fox" <name> said sternly, "it is time for you to tell us which way to go!" They turned and looked back at Esprit, but he wasn't there.  Instead, there stood a beautiful fairy, with long golden hair, a flowing white dress, and a magic wand that sparkled in the moonlight.

"Where did he go?" cried <name>. "What's happened to him?"

"It was me all along," the fairy said softly. "I am your teacher, but you had to learn for yourself.  Now tell me what you learned."

<name> tried to remember everything that had happened, and each of the adventures they had with the crafty fox.  <She_He> tried to remember what <she_he> learned from each one.

"First, I learned that temper never solves anything, and never leads to happiness.  I learned that if others are unkind, I mustn't grow angry, but I should smile and remain calm.

"Second, I learned that meanness given will be meanness returned.  If I wish kindness from others, I must show them kindness first."

"Last, I learned that there is a time to gaze in wonderment at the world around, and a time to keep your eyes on the road under your feet.  It is joyful to dream, but you must also keep your feet on the ground."

"You learned your lessons well, little <name>," the fairy said.  "You are clever now, and wise, and you are ready to go home and be a <princess_prince> again." 

"But I have to go to Aragon to go to school," <name> cried. "My father and mother said so!"

"Little <name>," said the fairy, "these are the forests of Aragon. That is why there is no sign at these crossroads - you don't need to know which way to go, because you are already here. But your lessons are finished now, until next year.   Go home to your parents, and tell them what you learned."

<name> thought for a moment.  Sage shook his head, as if that would help him understand.  <name> smiled, and said "Thank you, pretty fairy, for all that you have taught me.  I will never forget these lessons, and I will live by them for ever more."

"See that you do, little <name>," the fairy replied. "See that you do, and you will grow to be a wise and kind <queen_king> one day." And with that she spun around, and vanished in a cloud of fairy dust.

<name> and Sage turned around, and set off on the road back to the castle.  <name> did remember her lessons, and so <she_he> grew to become a <beautiful queen _ mighty king>, loved by all <her_him> kingdom for evermore.




Back to the party...

And with that, the troubadour finished his tale, and bowed to little <princess_prince> <name>.  Everyone in the great hall watched to see if <she_he> liked it.  Slowly, a smile formed on <name>'s face, and soon <she_he> glowed with happiness. The hall erupted into cheers and applause.

"Thank you! Thank you!" cried little <name>. "There is no better gift.  Your story told me all I need to know, to become a wise and caring <queen_king> one day!"  <She_He> looked up at <her_his> <mother_father>, and the <queen_king> smiled down at <her_him>.  Suddenly <name> knew, this was not just a story, this was a tale of how <her mother _ his father> became the <queen_king>, and how <she_he> became so loved by the entire kingdom.

<name> knew then that this story was a special gift. <She_He> knew that if <she_he> learned these lessons <she_he> would grow to be just like <her mother _ his father>, and that <she_he>, too, would live happily, ever after.
